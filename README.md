## Conjure the Crystals Game

### Welcome to my crystal collector game! I completed this game as an assigned homework project during my coding bootcamp.
### It makes use of JavaScript and jQuery to provide a random target number, and random number values assigned to four crystals.
### Each time you click a crystal, its value will be added to a running score, and the goal is to match that score to the target number.
### Wins and losses are tallied, and every new game the random number and crystal values are updated.

## Thanks and enjoy!
